= Introduction =

This app uses cURL and OpenSSL to connect to MLB.tv and play/save baseball games in Linux (and probably other OS's).  I wrote this because I really love my baseball and I really love my baseball in HD.

The code isn't pretty but it gets the job done.  I tried implementing bitrate switching but I haven't have time to test it so it probably doesn't work.

You also *need* a valid and paid for MLB.tv account to make this work.


= How to use =

First you need to checkout the source and compile.  Remember to have cURL and OpenSSL installed on your system.  Running 'make' should do it.  After that, you need to use this in conjunction with [http://mlbviewer.sourceforge.net/ mlbviewer].  After you've setup mlbviewer, you'll need to run the mlbplay.py app and get a Base64 encoded url:

python mlbplay.py v=nym n=1 nu=1

You may need to edit the mlbplay.py app at or around line 237 and comment out the sys.exit() :
{{{
        print 'An error occurred locating the media URL:'
        print g.error_str
        sys.exit()
}}}

become
{{{
        print 'An error occurred locating the media URL:'
        print g.error_str
        #sys.exit()
}}}

You may see an error about locating the media URL but this isn't a problem.  What you are concerned with is the Base64 encoded string.  This is what I get:

{{{
An error occurred locating the media URL:
Could not parse NexDef stream list.  Try alternate coverage.
